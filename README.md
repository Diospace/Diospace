## Hi there 👋


# 👋 Hi, I'm Endurance Ogun

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software developer passionate about numerical methods and web development. I enjoy building efficient algorithms and creating interactive web applications.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - **Numerical Methods Implementations**: Developing Python scripts for various iterative methods such as:
    - [Successive Over-Relaxation Method](https://github.com/Diospace/Successive-over_relaxation_method_for_iteration)
    - [Gauss-Seidel Iteration Method](https://github.com/Diospace/Gauss_Seidel_iteration_Method)
    - [Jacobi Iteration Method](https://github.com/Diospace/Jacobi-Iteration-Method-Python)
  - **Markov Chain Analysis**: Exploring stochastic processes through Python in my [Markov-Chain](https://github.com/Diospace/Markov-Chain) repository.

- 🌱 I’m learning:
  - Advanced numerical analysis techniques.
  - Web development frameworks to enhance my [personal website](https://github.com/Diospace/Diospace.github.io).

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Open-source projects related to numerical methods and algorithm optimization.
  - Web development projects that require integration of complex mathematical computations.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy tackling complex mathematical problems and bringing them to life through code.
